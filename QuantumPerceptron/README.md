# A Quantum Perceptron Algorithm

### Goals: 
1. Investigate the quantum perceptron algorithm proposed in the recent paper 
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-019-0140-4?amp%3Bcode=4cf1b507-7e23-4df0-a2a1-e82a3fe2bc4b
2. "Extend" the algorithm to a 1-qubit implementation
3. Examine the results and improve

### Results:
Please view the series of Jupyter Notebooks in the directory, `QuantumPerceptron`. The PDF provides a written report.

The notebooks titled  `Part1`, `Part2`, and `Part3` implement the quantum perceptron algorithm in a tutorial-like fasion. 

The notebook titled `1-qubit perceptron` features my extension of the work and shows how to create a 1-qubit percetpron which can classify 2-dimensional Boolean data. There is also an analysis on the algorithm's ability to learn Boolean functions and a novel training algorithm is introduced to extend the algorithm's learning ability.
