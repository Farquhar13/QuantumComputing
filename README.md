# A Quantum Perceptron Algorithm

### Goals: 
1. Journey into the magical land of quantum computing
2. Investigate the quantum perceptron algorithm proposed in the recent paper 
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-019-0140-4?amp%3Bcode=4cf1b507-7e23-4df0-a2a1-e82a3fe2bc4b
3. Demonstrate how the noise scales in the quantum perceptron algorithm
4. Examine the results of the noise tests to draw insights on how to best construct a neural network
